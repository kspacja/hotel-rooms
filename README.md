This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling with [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as a component library, which is built on top [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

### Testing remark

Because shadcn ui approach is to generate components and keep in repository, all `src/components/ui` are not covered by tests.
